## **Want to help?**

Whether you want to report a bug, make a suggestion for a possible new feature or change or implement changes yourself, your first point-of-call should by the [Issues](https://github.com/Maikuolan/phpMussel/issues) section of the repository. There, anything that I or any other current developers think should be implemented but need or want help with should be listed as well as any currently known reported bugs, issues, feature requests, ideas and other such things. If there's something you want to tell us that hasn't already been mentioned, feel free to start a new issue, or if there's an issue already mentioned that you want to comment on or contribute to, feel free to reply to that issue to say your part.

Remember that this is open source and that I've opted to license it under GNU/GPLv2, and so, if you want to fork your own copy of the project to make modifications to it of your own accord or otherwise, you don't need my permission to do so! In fact, I'd encourage others to fork their own copies and make their own modifications as they see fit. If you make a modification that you feel should be merged to the main master copy, send a pull request with a description of the changes you made and why you feel they should be merged, and I'll take a look at it and let you know how I feel about your changes.

I invite anyone interested in contributing to do so; You don't require special skillsets to contribute, as there are multiple areas in which contributions can be made:

**Can you test?**
- Testing phpMussel on your system and reporting your findings, along with any bugs you may find.

**Can you express?**
- If you have ideas for other features you'd like implemented, even if you're unable to code them yourself, either myself or someone else may potentially be able to.

**Can you code?**
- As much work as I may have managed to get done by myself, having a little help couldn't ever hurt!
- You could look over the existing code and try to find ways to make it better, cleaner and/or more efficient.
- There are things that I can do, and then there are things that I can't do. There are certain things that I want to do but which I'm not sure how to do; I've made mention of these things in the issues section of the repository.

**Can you translate?**
- We need translators! If you're able and willing to translate the documentation to your native language or if you're able to provide audits for translations already done but which may not always be accurate (I try to do translations myself for some languages, but English is my only fluent language, so, for my own translations, although I try my best, they'll undoubtedly have at least a few errors in them), you'll be immensely appreciated.

**Can you spread the word?**
- phpMussel won't serve any benefit to people unless they actually use it, and they won't ever use it unless they actually know about it. Getting word out would help (but please don't do anything spammy or unsolicited); Reviews at places where it's listed at, blog posts and word-of-mouth are helpful ways by which this could be done.

**Can you Git?**
- I'm pretty new to this whole Git thing myself, so even just sending a few pointers my way on how to do it better wouldn't go unappreciated! If I'm doing it wrong, and you tell me, I promise that I won't take offence.
